  # task_frame_to_PSM1_frame:
  # Always needed when the slave is used and it is constant as long as the
  # world or baswe frames of the arm are not moved.

  # task_frame_to_PSM2_frame
  # Always needed when the slave is used and it is constant as long as the
  # world or baswe frames of the arm are not moved.

  # world_frame_to_right_cam_frame:
  # in AR used only if right cam pose is not provided online, for VR read the
  # note bellow.

  # world_frame_to_left_cam_frame:
  # In AR used only if left cam pose is not provided online, for VR read the
  # note bellow.

  # MTMR_frame_to_image_frame and MTML_frame_to_image_frame:
  # This is used in VR mode, where the virtual tool follows master's pose
  # (instead of the slaves, in the AR mode). The transform is just a rotation
  # that takes the master poses to the image frame (opencv style: x is left
  # to right and y is top to bottom) and it is usually found by inspection.

  # NOTE FOR VR USE:
  # To set the virtual camera poses you can set the
  # world_frame_to_left_cam_frame if you want the camera to look at world from
  # a different angle and distance than the default one. the right cam pose
  # will be estimated using a fixed left_cam_to_right_cam transform we have
  # estimated from the da Vinci endoscopes.
